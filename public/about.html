<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Dzifa, a stay-at-home mum to four amazing kids and a passionate beginner in web development. 
  After years of dedicating myself to family life, I’ve decided to pursue a personal dream of learning to code 
  and building beautiful, functional websites.</p>

<p>Balancing motherhood and learning has its challenges, but it’s also an incredible journey. I’m inspired to show my kids 
  that it’s never too late to chase your dreams and try something new. My ultimate goal is to create websites that are not
   only functional but also inspiring, and perhaps even launch my own web development business someday.</p>

<p>Thank you for stopping by my corner of the internet. Whether you’re here to connect, collaborate, or just say hi, I’d 
  love to hear from you. Together, let’s celebrate learning, growth, and the beauty of juggling dreams and family life!

  Warmly,
  Dzifa</p>
